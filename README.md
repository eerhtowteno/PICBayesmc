#PICBayesmc
Bayesian Semiparametric Partially Linear Cure Models with Partly Interval-censored Data

The main program is in file "PICBayesmc.R", which can produce the estimated covariate effects in terms of point estimates, standard errors, and DIC, as well as the estimated survival functions and unknown functions using a Bayesian approach. 

Some necessary functions are given in the file "help.R".

One needs to put the two files in the working directory before running the main program in file "PICBayesmc.R".
